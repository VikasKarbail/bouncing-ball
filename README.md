# bouncing-ball

The bouncing ball project is a simple game built using OpenGL and GLUT library in C++. The objective of the game is to control a ball bouncing within a window and score points by making the ball touch the boundaries or objects within the window.

The game consists of two levels, and the player must complete each level within a time limit of ten seconds. Each time the ball makes contact with a boundary or an object, the player's score increases. Once the score reaches ten in the first level, the player advances to the second level.

In the second level, the speed of the ball increases, making it more challenging for the player to control the ball and score points. The player must navigate the ball carefully to prevent it from bouncing out of bounds or colliding with obstacles.

At the end of both levels, the game displays the score achieved in each level, allowing the player to assess their performance.

The project utilizes OpenGL for rendering the graphics and GLUT (OpenGL Utility Toolkit) for creating the game window, handling input, and managing the game loop. By leveraging these libraries, the project provides a visually appealing and interactive gaming experience.

The bouncing ball game serves as a fun and engaging way to practice coordination and reflexes while enjoying a simple gaming experience. Players can challenge themselves to improve their scores or compete with friends to achieve the highest scores.

In this project, we are demonstrating the game in which the ball will have a random motion and with every mouse click on the ball, the score will be incremented and the speed of the ball will be increased making the game difficult for the player. The ball will collide with the boundaries of the window and move in a random direction.

The player needs to click on the ball which will increment the score by 1 point for each consecutive click. The game has two levels. In Level 1, the player needs to score 10 points in order to proceed to the next level and next level, level 2 with be with increased difficulty. 

The time allotted for each level is 10 seconds. The score will be displayed at the top for each level along with time so as to keep a record of the points and time respectively. The final score is displayed to the player at the end of the game.
